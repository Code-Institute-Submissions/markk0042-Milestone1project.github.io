OVERVIEW:

HI reader,

Welcome to my milestone-one project for code Institutes 1 of 4 projects for my journey to become a full stack developer.

In my current project I picked to do it on, is about a gym because in 2020 alot of pwople have become close/ connected to fitness, by using it to get in better shape, a hobby, a way to meet up with friends, to improve how they look and for improving mental health etc. and it shows the gyms home page designed into sections where at the top of the page where the gyms logo is and also the nav bar feature, where the gallery has images of the gym and its members working out (taken from free open source images)(https://www.pexels.com/collections/crossfit-gym-exercise-workout-training-rhf4lf3/) head of my gym introduction page we have a jumbotron showing the company slogan, a highlighted element where if you purchase a membership you get in return a free extension onto your membership, then down below we have features about the gym for example different types or areas of exercise that one person can do at this facility, with a option to view the time tables or book in with a Personal Trainer, then below that we have a footer section, used footer layout from (https://mdbootstrap.com/products/jquery-ui-kit/) styled it with my own colors and fonts, but and added links to the titles. with a quote on the left about the company, in the center of the footer we have links to different areas of the site that would be available to an existing member or to a new upoming member, then to the right of the footer we have the contact deatils like address, email, contact information etc with a copyright logo at the bottom of the footer.

When the site is viewed on a mobile version I have made some of the content be hidden due to too much content being shown and it looks too squashed so I hid some less important parts, when viewed on a mobile the navbar condenses and becomes a burger feature/ drop down menu which has the sections still present, just not clustered all over the screen...


UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things:



In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

I used inspiration from previous projects I completed in code Insititute as my journey into the full Stack Developer Role
for example which i thought was pretty cool and interesting(the jumbotron feature).

I also used slack groups for guidance and assitance from the well educated mentors,
